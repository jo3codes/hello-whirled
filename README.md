sow the wind and reap the whirlwind

Interesting how many job postings want to see your github profile so here you go. I haven't yet had a need to create a new project on github or contribute, but I have used version control systems in the past. Maybe I'll start something small here and it'll grow into something useful.

You can also find some technical writing on subjects I find interesting at joecodes.com. You'll see my focus is security, stability, speed, and simplicity. Maybe it will inspire someone.
